How to create a PR from an issue using [Gitpod](https://gipod.io).

Feel free to fork this repo.

The process below assumes that you have push access to the repo for which a PR is being created. A similar flow is possible using a fork.

### Steps:
- Create an issueÂ in the repo (if no issue exists yet) and start from the issue URL.
- Open in Gitpod by prefixing the issue URL with `https://gitpod.io/#`.
- Once the workspace is open, note the new branch name.
- push changes to that branch.
- create the PR from the branch.
